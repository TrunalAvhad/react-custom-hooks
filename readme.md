## 📌 Problem Statement  
The objective of this assignment is to create a custom React hook named `useFetch` to simplify fetching data from an API. The hook should manage loading and error states and return fetched data in a reusable way.

---

## 📖 Description  
In React applications, API data fetching is a common requirement. Instead of writing the same fetch logic in every component, a custom hook is created to make the process reusable and cleaner.  

This project implements a `useFetch` custom hook using React hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useCallback`. The hook fetches data from a dummy API and displays it in a React component.
